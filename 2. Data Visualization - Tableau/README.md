# Tableau Public COVID-19 Data Visualization Project

# Project Overview
This project uses SQL queries to prepare datasets for visualizing COVID-19 statistics on Tableau Public. The aim is to provide clear and impactful visual representations of COVID-19's impact, including case counts, death rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress worldwide.

# Data Source
The data is extracted from the PortfolioProject database, using the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables.

# Features and Queries
Global COVID-19 Overview: Aggregated global data to show total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.
Non-Country Entities Analysis: Data exclusions for non-country entities like 'World' and 'European Union' to maintain geographic consistency.
Infection and Mortality Rates: Queries to calculate the highest infection counts and death rates per location, factoring in population sizes for accurate representation.
Vaccination Tracking: Analysis of vaccination data to show rolling totals and percentages of populations vaccinated over time.
Temporal and Geographical Granularity: Breakdowns by location and date to track COVID-19's spread and control measures' effectiveness over time.
Insights
Death Rates vs. Cases: Visualizations that explore the relationship between confirmed cases and resulting deaths, highlighting the deadliest outbreaks.
Population Infection Rates: Maps and charts showing which regions have had the highest proportion of their populations infected.
Vaccination Progress: Timelines and distribution maps of vaccination rollouts, providing insights into global and regional vaccination efforts.
# Usage
SQL Execution: Run the provided SQL scripts to generate the necessary data extracts.
Tableau Setup: Import the datasets into Tableau to create the visualizations.
Interactive Elements: Utilize Tableau’s interactive capabilities, such as filters and drill-downs, to explore different dimensions of the data.

# Future Enhancements
This visualization project can be expanded by incorporating additional metrics such as age demographics, economic impacts, or more detailed vaccination data to provide deeper insights.

# Note
This README assumes familiarity with SQL and Tableau. It is designed to help users understand and replicate the data visualization process outlined in this project for COVID-19 data analysis.

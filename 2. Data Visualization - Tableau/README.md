# Tableau Public COVID-19 Data Visualization Project

# Project Overview
This project utilizes SQL queries to prepare 2 datasets for visualizing COVID-19 statistics on Tableau Public. The goal is to deliver clear and impactful visual representations of COVID-19's effects on a global scale.

## Data Source
The data is extracted from the PortfolioProjectCOVID database, specifically from the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables.

## Insights
- **Death Rates vs Cases:** Visualizations that explore the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths.
- **Population Infection Rates:** Maps and timelines showing which countries have had the highest proportion of their populations infected.

## Usage
- **SQL Execution:** Execute the provided SQL queries to produce the required data extracts.
- **Copy & Paste Data:** After executing each query the user must copy the results and paste them into an Excel worksheet. 
- **Tableau Public Setup:** Import the workbooks into Tableau to create the visualizations.
- **Interactive Elements:** Leverage Tableau's features to explore various dimensions of the data.

Description
This project is a comprehensive data exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on key metrics like infection rates, death rates, and vaccination coverage. It uses a variety of SQL techniques to extract, analyze, and visualize data, with the goal of understanding the global impact of the pandemic and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts. The project demonstrates skills in beginner-level SQL queries, data manipulation, and the creation of advanced analytical constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temporary Tables, and Views.

Key Features
Data Selection and Filtering: The project selects relevant COVID-19 data, filtering out records where continent information is missing. This ensures that all analyses are focused on geographical regions with complete data.

Calculations on COVID-19 Impact:

Death Percentage: Calculates the likelihood of dying if infected with COVID-19, broken down by country.
Infection Rate: Evaluates the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 on a daily basis.
Highest Infection and Death Rates: Identifies countries and continents with the highest infection and death rates.
Vaccination Analysis:

Rolling Vaccination Counts: Computes the cumulative number of vaccinations administered per day for each location, providing insights into vaccination rollout over time.
Vaccination Coverage: Calculates the percentage of the population vaccinated, using both CTEs and Temporary Tables to achieve similar results through different SQL approaches.
Creation of Views: The project concludes with the creation of a SQL View that stores the vaccination coverage data, which can be used later for further analysis and visualization in external tools like Power BI or Tableau.

Insights Derived
Infection vs. Death Rates: The project highlights the differences in death rates among countries, offering a perspective on the severity of the pandemic in different regions.
Vaccination Progress: By tracking rolling vaccination counts, the project provides insights into how different countries have progressed in their vaccination efforts and how this correlates with population size.
Global Impact Assessment: Aggregated global numbers provide a macro view of the pandemic, showing total cases, deaths, and the overall death percentage.
Setup and Usage
Data Source: The project assumes that the data is available in a SQL Server database, specifically within the PortfolioProjectCOVID schema. It uses two key tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations.

Execution:

SQL Environment: The SQL scripts should be executed in an environment that supports T-SQL, such as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Running Queries: Each section of the script can be run independently to generate different insights, from basic data selection to complex calculations.
Output:

Temporary Tables and Views: The project creates temporary tables and views that store intermediate results, which can be queried and visualized in future analyses.
Future Scope
Time-Series Analysis: Implement more advanced time-series analysis to model and predict future trends in COVID-19 cases and vaccinations.
Regional Comparisons: Extend the analysis to include more granular regional data, such as states or provinces, to provide deeper insights at a local level.
Integration with BI Tools: Link the output views with business intelligence tools like Power BI or Tableau for dynamic visualization and dashboard creation.
Advanced Statistical Analysis: Incorporate machine learning algorithms to predict the effectiveness of vaccines and identify factors influencing infection and death rates.
Note
This project provides a strong foundation in SQL for COVID-19 data exploration and analysis. It is designed to be adaptable, allowing for the integration of additional data sources or the extension of existing queries to answer new questions. The methodologies demonstrated here are not only applicable to pandemic data but can also be used for any large-scale data exploration and analysis tasks in various domains.
